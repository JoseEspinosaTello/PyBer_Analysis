# PyBer_Analysis# Overview of the analysis:

## Purpose

After an analysis of large date, we provided PyBer V. Isualize statistical analysis on the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides. PyBer V. Isualize has now requested a new rundown of the weekly fares for each city type. A multi-line graph will be provided to help visualize the analysis. The new data will help the company make decisions on resource allocation and help the company increase profits in struggling areas.
