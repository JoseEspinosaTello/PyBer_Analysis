# PyBer_Analysis# Overview of the analysis:

## Purpose

After an analysis of large date, we provided PyBer V. Isualize statistical analysis on the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and rides. PyBer V. Isualize has now requested a new rundown of the weekly fares for each city type. A multi-line graph will be provided to help visualize the analysis. The new data will help the company make decisions on resource allocation and help the company increase profits in struggling areas.

## Results:

We learned that most of PyBer’s business takes place in urban locations as urban locations account for 68% of total rides. Urban locations also have the most available drivers as 81% of PyBer drivers work in an urban setting. As a result, urban areas generated the most in total fares for the company at $39,854.38.
However, the averages tell a different story as Rural areas as , dominated in average fare per ride and average fare per driver after ranking last in total rides, total drivers and total fares. Rural drivers earn more per ride sitting at $34.62 per ride which is nearly $4 mor per ride that suburban drives and over $10 than urban drivers.

### PyBer Weekly total Fare by City Type

Urban:

Urban area sit atop as they fluctuate between $1,500 - $2,500 across the four months. January was the least profitable month starting off at just about $1,500 per week and hitting a high of $2,200 for the month. Starting with February there is a steady increase with a few down weeks in March. Overall, no month drops below $1,900 per week after January. The graph proves once again the urban areas are the most profitable.

Suburban:

Suburban weekly profits fluctuate in the $700 - $1,500 range. Suburban areas start low for the year at around $700 , however, suburban areas hold steady through out the year as weekly profits never drop below $800. Suburban areas peaked in late February by hitting a high of $1,400 finishing, and overall second in total fares.
 

Rural:

Rural areas once again finished last as the total weekly fares fluctuate between $100 - $600. Rural areas hit a low in early January at an estimated $100. Rural area hit a high in April at just over $500. Overall rural areas don’t show much promise with lows almost at or below $100 several times.

### Summary

With gas prices on the rise, the time to make changes and increase PyBer prices has arrived. People will be looking to leave their vehicles at home whenever possible. And this could be very beneficial for the company.  After analysis of the PyBer V. Isualize data our team has made the following recommendations:

Increase the drivers in urban areas and look into lowering prices. Urban areas are where PyBer sees most of its profits and becoming more competitive in urban areas is the key to higher profits for the company. People in urban areas are more willing to use alternative transportation as their drives are short and it eliminates the need to pay for parking in certain areas. Increasing the number of drivers while decreasing fares will take riders from our competitors and increase profits for the company

Suburban area are steady on a weakly bases. The weekly fares never drop too low and have occasional sharp increases. People in suburban area are willing to pay high fares for our services. It would be beneficial to increase prices and keep the driver count steady in suburban areas. These changes will increase the average fare per ride and driver in the area and allow us to focus on adding drivers to urban areas.

Increasing the price will and decreasing the number of drivers in rural areas will be the most beneficial approach. Total weekly profits showed that profits almost hit lower that $100 several times in rural areas. People in rural areas drive long distances and prefer to use their personal vehicles for transportation. Putting more drivers in these areas will not increase profits for the company. Increasing the average fare price will help drive up profits per ride, while taking drivers from rural areas and focusing on adding drivers in areas will be more beneficial for the company.
